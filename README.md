# On-Air-R2-DEV
This Repo is a WIP. Arduino Sketches can be found in the firmware folder. One sketch tests the digital potentiometer and one is the latest firmware which is a simple application of the [HomeSpan library](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan) by Gregg Berman.

I also included any DSView captures in the Logic Analyzer Captures folder.
